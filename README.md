## _Mock Database - with basic crud operations_

Mock Database Utility is an effort towards learning JAVA.

It comprises of basic operations like
- GET - _to just procure all the contents_
- POST - _to create or append a new data in the existing file or a new file_
- PUT - _to update an existing data_
- DELETE - _to delete an existing data_

Take a look at *`adhoc`* folder inside *`main/java`* folder to know how to use the utility.

## Features

> The Mock Database needs you to provide a apikey
> which would basically be your name (since i hadnt added authentication yet)
> and then an entity name which would basically be the type of data (users, mails, etc.).
> This structure would create a new folder for every apikey
> and create a new filename.json where filename would be the entityname.
